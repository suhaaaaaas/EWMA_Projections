# EWMA_Projections
This repository contains the function synthesize_projection, which generates a dynamic sports performance projection by combining multiple data sources. Sportsbook lines (betting market confidence), Season-long historical statistics (with EWMA smoothing), Head-to-head (H2H) matchup data (recent games weighted higher)
